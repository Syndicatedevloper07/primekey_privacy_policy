  <h1>Privacy Policy for PrimeKey</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 11, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>PrimeKey is a simple, offline password manager that does <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal user data</strong>. Your passwords are stored securely on your device only.</p>

  <h2>2. Internet Access for Ads</h2>
  <p>PrimeKey includes ads for monetization. To serve these advertisements, the app requires internet access.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal or behavioral data is collected for ad targeting.</li>
    <li>No user data is transmitted to our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
<p>PrimeKey does <strong>not collect</strong> any personal or user-generated data. Your passwords and sensitive content remain stored <strong>only on your device</strong>.</p>
<p>However, we use <strong>Google Firebase Crashlytics</strong> to collect anonymous crash data to improve app stability and performance. This may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device type and OS version</li>
  <li>Crash stack traces</li>
  <li>Basic usage info at the time of crash</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No personal identifiers or user content are included</strong> in these reports.</p>


 <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use third-party services for both ads and crash analytics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> To display ads</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> To collect crash and diagnostic data</li>
</ul>
<p>These services may collect device-related data (e.g., IP address, OS version) according to their privacy policies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
</ul>


  <h2>5. Data Safety & Security</h2>
  <p>No sensitive data is transmitted off-device by PrimeKey. Internet access is used only to fetch ads.</p>
  <p>The app operates entirely on your device. No user data is uploaded, shared, or stored remotely.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can uninstall PrimeKey anytime to remove any app data. No user data is retained by us.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about privacy, please contact:</p>
