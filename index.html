  <h1>Privacy Policy for PrimeKey</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 11, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>PrimeKey is a simple, offline password manager that does <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal user data</strong>. Your passwords are stored securely on your device only.</p>

  <h2>2. Internet Access for Ads</h2>
  <p>PrimeKey includes ads for monetization. To serve these advertisements, the app requires internet access.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal or behavioral data is collected for ad targeting.</li>
    <li>No user data is transmitted to our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>PrimeKey does <strong>not collect</strong> any of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal identifiers (name, email, phone)</li>
    <li>User content (passwords, notes) — all stored locally</li>
    <li>Analytics, crash reporting, or logging</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, ad networks may collect standard ad-related data (e.g., device IP) solely for delivering ads.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Ad Providers</h2>
  <p>Ads are delivered by third-party networks (e.g. AdMob). Their <strong>own privacy policies</strong> apply. We are not responsible for their data collection practices. You can review them here:</p>

    <!-- Add more networks here if applicable -->
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Safety & Security</h2>
  <p>No sensitive data is transmitted off-device by PrimeKey. Internet access is used only to fetch ads.</p>
  <p>The app operates entirely on your device. No user data is uploaded, shared, or stored remotely.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can uninstall PrimeKey anytime to remove any app data. No user data is retained by us.</p>
